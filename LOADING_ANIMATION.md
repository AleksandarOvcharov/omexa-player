# YouTube-Style Loading Animation

The Omexa Player now features a beautiful **YouTube-style spinning loading animation** that appears during video loading and buffering states.

## ‚ú® Animation Features

### **Visual Design**
- **48px diameter** spinning circle (YouTube-like proportions)
- **Red accent color** (#ff6b6b) matching the player theme
- **Glowing drop-shadow** effect for visual appeal
- **Smooth rotation** at 0.8 seconds per cycle
- **Fade-in animation** with scaling effect
- **Modern styling** with subtle text shadows

### **Smart Behavior**
- **Initial Loading**: Shows "Loading..." when video first loads
- **Buffering State**: Shows "Loading..." during playback interruptions
- **Prevents Duplicates**: Only one spinner visible at a time
- **Consistent Text**: Always shows "Loading..." for all loading states
- **Responsive**: Works in both regular and fullscreen modes

## üé¨ When It Appears

| State | Trigger | Text |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Initial Load** | Video first requested | "Loading..." |
| **Video Buffering** | Network interruption during playback | "Loading..." |
| **Seeking** | Jumping to unloaded video parts | "Loading..." |
| **Network Issues** | Connection problems | "Loading..." |

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Loading States**
```javascript
// Initial loading (YouTube & Video)
player.showLoading();    // Shows "Loading..." with spinner
player.hideLoading();    // Removes loading spinner

// Buffering during playback
player.showBuffering();  // Shows "Loading..." with spinner  
player.hideBuffering();  // Removes buffering spinner
```

### **Event Handling**
- **Regular Videos**: Listens to `waiting`, `canplay`, `playing` events
- **YouTube Videos**: Handles `BUFFERING` state changes from YouTube API
- **Smart Detection**: Won't show buffering during initial load phase

### **CSS Animation**
```css
.omexa-loading-spinner {
  animation: omexa-spin 0.8s linear infinite;
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 8px rgba(255, 107, 107, 0.3));
}

@keyframes omexa-fade-in {
  0% { opacity: 0; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.8); }
  100% { opacity: 1; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(1); }
}
```
